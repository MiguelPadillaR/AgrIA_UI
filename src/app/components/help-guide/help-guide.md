# AGRIA's HELP GUIDE
Welcome to the help section! Here you can learn how to use each one of AgrIA's features.

## How to use AgrIA
### Parcel finder view:
It all starts at the **Parcel Finder** section. Go to it by simply clicking on the navbar or corresponding button. Read the indicatiosn carefully: 
- You may only use 20 characters for the cadastral reference code.
- Image fetching of urban parcels is not supported.
- Updated parcel images are available only for the Andalusia area.

You should be able to obtain your state's cadastral reference code from your property-related documents or by searching using publicly available goverment tools. Once you have it, simply input the code in its corresponding field and choose a date. The day's date is set as default. The "Clear from" button will remove the cadastral code and reset the date to default.

Processing time may vary form parcel to parcel. The whole process lasts about a minute and should take no longer than two, so be patient if you notice an extensive waiting period. Once the parcel's image is loaded and displayed, you will be able to send the image for analysis with the "Confirm Parcel" button. An additional "Detailed description" checkbox will appear to indicat if the user wants a more in-depth description and analysis.

After confirming the parcel's image, you will be autimatically redirected to the Chat view.

### Chat view:
AgrIA's main feautre is the ability to interact with it via Chat messaging and be able to ask question and get personalized feedback on agricultural practices and other tips and tricks. Users may use the "Send" button to send their message and, if they are not sure what could be interesting to know, the may use the "Get Suggestion" button to have a prompt that will inquire more about AgrIA's last response.

You may access the Chat view in one of two ways:
1. You have been redirected from the Parcel Finder view.
2. You have accessed via the navbar.

This access difference makes the image description more or less accurate, respectively. Interaction wise, is basically the same regardless.

#### Parcel Finder access:
Using this access provides the bests results for image analysis. Image will be uploaded on the chat's image display and an assesment and description query with detailed information about the parcel will have already been issued. User may interact and asks questions after the first response.

#### Navbar access:
Using the navbar access will load the chat history (if any) and will let the user interact directly with AgrIA. User may upload an image of a parcel's satellite view for analysis. The model will then provide a description based solely on the visual elements without the corresponding SIGPAC classification that greatly increases accuracy. This information will be prompted to the user after concluding description. If the user provides it, AgrIA will respond wiht a more accurate analysis and classification.
